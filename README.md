# Regime-switching-in-financial-bar-data

Abstract:

In this project, we have developed Python and R models to estimate the parameters of a  Markov- switching model. It should be noted that there have been several studies performing similar kind of analysis, but none of the referenced papers or textbooks have a working code in R/Python to implement such a model. The methods explored in this project are Maximum Likelihood estimation and Gibbs sampling. This project also tests the model performance using a simulator and then fits the model to the data set provided by QSquared Capital. The resulting data-driven model that will assist us in making decisions without the knowledge of the underlying asset. The applications are wide from tactical allocation to blocking trades when high volatility regimes are predicted.
